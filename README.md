## Description
    
*Employer-Profile Generator* is a CLI (Command-Line Interface) apps that dynamically generates a employer profile. This application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members including engineerings and interns. The user can input any number of team members. This project must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
